# RESTAURANT

## Description

The website design was created mainly to practice bootstrap on the basis of an existing website of an American pizzeria. Link to the original page below.

The home page is divided into sections, which you can move to by scrolling or clicking the appropriate button in the menu at the top. 

The "Order" and "Reservation" sections take you to external websites where you can make a purchase.

The remaining sections are subpages: the "Menu" and "Drinks" sections contain a tab with all available meals and drinks. In the "Parties" section, table reservations can be made and "Contact" is for general contact with the restaurant.

Clicking on the restaurant's logo in the upper left corner of the menu will take you to the home page.

The slider created with the use of a bootstrap carousel contains up-to-date information about the restaurant.

The footer of the website includes the address and telephone number, as well as restaurant opening hours and links to social media.
